 # What Is YOLO?
YOLO is a real-time object detection system that sees the whole image only once—just like how we humans glance and understand a scene in one shot.

- You give YOLO an image, and it says:

- "Hey, that’s a car at (x, y, width, height)"

- "There’s a person here"

- And it does this in one pass (one forward pass through the network).
